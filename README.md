## ECE Senior Design Spring 2025. Classifying Invasive Species using Drone Images and Deep Learning.
These are colab notebooks Ziek Moreno used to complete Task 5 in our project. There is 3 different notebooks:
- and initial notebook where I first tested using the yolov11 model both Landon and Joey were using at the time
- A first test run using our alternative model yolov8 to make sure everything worked ok and was ready for larger testing with more images
- A version 2 of this notebook where I tested with more images using all 4 classes to try and maximize the results.
